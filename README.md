**See branch `v3` for progress handling new database formats.**

*USA Cycling has updated their file formats for the membership database substantially. Work has begun on a new version of this toolkit. I have not tested the current version against the new file formats and therefore the current version should be considered unsupported.*

# USA Cycling Database Tools
Tools for working with the USA Cycling member "database" (CSV files *cough cough*) in Python. In other words, some help for the programming-inclined USA Cycling promoter.

The current focus is on getting data from the CSV files into a more useful format (no, copying and pasting into Excel is not actually more useful).
